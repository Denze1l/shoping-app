Hello everyone! 
Here is my project of a shopping app that was created using modern stuck of technologies. The main reason of this project for me is to get in touch with Redux hooks and Redux Toolkit. Also, this app is connected to  https://console.firebase.google.com/ . It sends and receives requests from my personal realtime database. That is why, to see the correct workflow, you should connect to the server!
Few words about structure:
-App.js is the main file wich combines logic from all other components; 
-Store folder consists of all redux logic. Each file is a redux-toolkit createSlice element, and index hear is the store setup element that combines all slices;
-Components folder consists of all components of my app and  their css files. 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/). Many thanks to Nikhil Thadani and his youtube courses (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrs7u6bdbUw&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org), and his github repository (https://github.com/Nikhilthadani/Redux-Shopping-Cart-App/tree/StartingApp) with the react template, that made building this project way more easier.
